# Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
## Project Overview

This project analyzes Blinkit’s sales performance, customer ratings, and outlet-level efficiency using Power BI.
The goal is not visualization, but business decision support using clearly defined KPIs and analytical views.

This dashboard answers real operational and sales questions faced by quick-commerce businesses.

# Business Objectives

Identify key revenue drivers across products and outlets

Analyze the impact of fat content and item type on total sales

Compare outlet performance by size, location, and establishment age

Provide a single-view KPI summary for management decision-making

## KPIs Defined

Total Sales – Overall revenue generated

Average Sales – Revenue per transaction

Number of Items – Total unique items sold

Average Rating – Customer satisfaction indicator

These KPIs are calculated dynamically using DAX measures.
